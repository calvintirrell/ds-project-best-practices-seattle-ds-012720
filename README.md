# DS Project Deliverable Best Practices

This lesson covers best practices for three different types of DS project deliverables.  All examples were created by Flatiron School DS coaches in the DC campus, and represent a "mod 3" project that predicts rainfall in Australia.

We've all seen them before, but let's look at a couple of examples and discuss:

 - [First presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i2_9VSOeX78UK6EGrUNnI9j4b7PPt_hia_8z1DWYju0/edit#slide=id.p)
 - [Second presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vvnya28jwm7EBWDImB-easLgUZuW3Uj_gJSpTeITYnw/edit#slide=id.p)

## Markdown Documents

Markdown is a very common format for writing technical documents.  We ask you to write a `README.md` and `memo.md` for each project.

Let's look at these examples:

 - [First markdown document](/markdown-examples/README-1.md)
 - [Second markdown document](/markdown-examples/README-2.md)

## Jupyter Notebooks

You've worked with plenty of exploratory notebooks, but let's talk about presentation notebooks:

 - [First presentation notebook](/notebook-examples/V1_Australia_rain.ipynb)
 - [Second presentation notebook](/notebook-examples/V2_Australia_rain.ipynb)
 - [Third presentation notebook](/notebook-examples/V3_Australia_rain.ipynb)
